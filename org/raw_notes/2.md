The address of the instruction (function) itself has the instruction of where each parameter goes. 

# Gargalo de Von Neumann
- Can't access memory address at the same time. Must be done sequentially.
Can't do it in same cycle.

## Memory
- A memory is composede of memory cells, each one contains an address.
Each memory cell stores 1 byte, 8 bits
- In case one instruction exceeds the memory cell value, it is divided into two cells.

word - 32 bits - 4 bytes
half-word - 16 bits - 2 bytes
double-word - 64 bits - 8 bytes

- Front-side bus
- Barramento -> Lines that connect circuits
111 111 6 bits so yo wont forget
There must be at least 8 bits arrays or more for each memory address

- Barramento de controle, barramento de dados, barramento de endereÃ§os
- No barramento de controle -> Informs address (contents?) and what to do
- When writing, must inform what to write and where to write
- When reading, must inform where to read and what to do
- Must study what processor is outputting when and what cpu is outputting when / inputting

Driver is the instruction that manages input ouput behaviour and memory reading writing instructions, ex for a printer
CPU doesnt know what to do. It needs to talk to the driver in order to know. It just throws the memory address into the driver and it does what it's specialized to do

- Cache memory. Used for faster access in memory.

- Nowadays modern processors have a north bridge integrated into the chip
