#  Notes from self-study
1. x86 is variable length while Arm/Risc V always has 32 bits 
In this manner the hardware always knows where one instruction ends
and the other begins.
2. RISC is highly dependent on registers to reduce slow memory accesses due to their load-store approach

## CISC VS RISC
CISC is preferred for single-threaded performance. The trade off is higher power consumption and greater heat generation, so it requires more cooling solutions.


RISC is made to be more power efficient from the ground up. For this reason, it has been more used in smartphones, tables and embedded devices. Apple, however, has explored the m-series which proves ARM can be used for computing, and can sometimes exceed x86 and CISC.
