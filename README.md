 A byte
is eight bits. Two bytes side by side are called a word, and two words side
by side are called a double word. A quad word, as you might imagine, consists
of two double words, for four words or eight bytes in all. Going in the other
direction, some people refer to a group of four bits as a nybbleâ€”a nybble being
somewhat smaller than a byte.
